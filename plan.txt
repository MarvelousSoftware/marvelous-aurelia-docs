TODO:
  - create NuGet packages
  - update all aurelia packages
  
Once packages are created:
  - create readme.md files
  - add dependencies to package.json files
  - test in sample-navigation project
  - create automated process for changelog creation
  - make it available via `jspm install package-name`

Further plans:
  - check google analitycs statistics
  - newsletter?

BUGS:

    General:
      - Entering for the first time on "Rows and columns" page results with "Type" field being not tracked for visibility changes. 
        Looks like an aurelia bug.
  Query Language:
    - For some reason "City is not empty" doesn't work on Basic view
