Pagination allows to specify default page size (`size` attribute) and all available page sizes (`all` attribute). If page sizes are specified
then user is able to change the size of the page using dropdown on the bottom right of the grid.

NOTE: pagination integrates well with remote binding. With `ASP.NET` and `MarvelousSoftware.Grid.DataSource` package installed only
the part of data which is needed to be displayed on the screen is being downloaded from the server. Binding to remote data is demonstrated
[here](#/grid/sample/data-source-remote-data).
