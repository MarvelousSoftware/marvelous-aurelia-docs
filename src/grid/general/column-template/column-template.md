Sometimes the data is not in the correct format and it should be adjusted as per business requirements. In such case column template is a perfect fit. 
It allows to display anything in a cell and it has access to `$row` which holds information about current row such as bound data. Besides that it also has an access
to the view model within which the grid is being declared. In this demo it is presented by `show` method usage which is implemented in `ColumnTemplate` controller.
