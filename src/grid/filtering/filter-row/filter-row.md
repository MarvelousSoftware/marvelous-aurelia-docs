Filter row allows to search for data using predefined filters. These filters varies depending on the type of
column which needs to be explicitly declared. Supported types are:
* `string` (default)
* `number`
* `boolean`
* `date`

NOTE: Currently filtering supports remote binding only. Local binding will be supported in the future.
