  <h1>Getting started</h1>
  <p>
    The <code>marvelous-aurelia-forms</code> is an open source component based on <a href="http://aurelia.io/">aurelia framework</a>.
    It creates forms using provided schemas and allows to get rid of extremely repetitive code like HTML form templates
    and validation. Out of the box it provides simple controls, but more is about to come. It allows to create custom controls
    and validators. It is also great to dynamically create a form while application is already running (for instance based on user's input).

    Please bear in mind that this library is still in the beta and some features (like translations support) might be missing.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>
    <p>To install the library just use jspm:</p>
    <pre class="highlight"><code>jspm install marvelous-aurelia-forms</code></pre>

    <p>Then it is required to load the css file and let know aurelia about the forms plugin:</p>
    <pre class="typescript highlight"><code>import 'marvelous-aurelia-forms/styles/default.css!';
// ...

export function configure(aurelia) {  
  let config = aurelia.use;
  
  config
    // ...
    .plugin('marvelous-aurelia-forms');
  
  aurelia.start().then(a => {
    a.setRoot();
  });
}
</code></pre>
  </p>
  
  <h3>Configuration</h3>
  <p>The marvelous-aurelia-forms library defines default configuration in the following file:</p>
  <m-code language="typescript" file-path="forms/getting-started/config.ts"></m-code>
  <p>In order to change default values use aurelia plugin configuration:</p>
  <m-code language="typescript" file-path="forms/getting-started/aurelia-config.ts"></m-code>
  
  <h3>HTML Based approach</h3>
  <p>One of the design decisions was to support not only model based approach, but also HTML based, like in the following example:</p>
  <m-code language="html" file-path="forms/getting-started/html-based-example.html"></m-code>
  <p>
    It has been implemented in the early version, but one of the aurelia updates broke it. Currently aurelia 
    <a href="https://github.com/aurelia/framework/issues/210#issuecomment-141605960">doesn't support</a>
    extending custom elements which is a big issue for this particular library. The early version used a trick which apparently is not valid
    any more. Therefore HTML Based approach will have to wait for extending custom elements support. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>Browser support</h3>
  <p>Currently only modern browsers are supported, but IE >= 9 support is on the TODO list.</p>
