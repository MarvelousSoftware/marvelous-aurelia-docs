Sometimes predefined field types are not enough. If that is the case then custom one should be created. Thankfully it is not hard and this example is all about showing
how to archive it. What is nice about custom fields is that only one class is needed and then `MarvelousAureliaForms` is able to render it using both 
approaches: HTML based and Model based. It is up to field user to pick one which is most suitable.
