`MarvelousAureliaForms` provides out of the box only generic validators like required or length. In case if that is not enough it is recommended to create a custom validator.
There are 2 ways of supplying custom validators:
* Inline, directly in the schema
* Global, for all forms across the application

This example shows how to use the former option.
